# Real-Time Sketch Classification with a Convolutional Neural Network

This project is a recreation of Google's "Quick, Draw!" game, where a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to classify hand-drawn sketches in real-time. The application includes a Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing and model training, and a Tkinter-based GUI for users to draw and get live predictions.

## Project Overview

The core of this project is a CNN model built with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a subset of the "Quick, Draw!" dataset to recognize sketches across 14 different categories. The project demonstrates a full machine learning workflow: data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment in a simple graphical user interface.

## Dataset

The project uses a curated subset of the vast [Google Quick, Draw! Dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset). The raw data (`.npy` files) is **not** included in this repository and should be downloaded separately if you wish to re-train the model.

The 14 categories used for this project are:
- Airplane
- Bicycle
- Camera
- Dog
- Envelope
- Flower
- Hot air balloon
- Ice cream
- Lighthouse
- Mailbox
- Pizza
- Radio
- Star
- Windmill

## Model Architecture

The final model is a Sequential CNN designed to balance performance and efficiency.

-   **Convolutional Layers**: Two `Conv2D` layers with (5x5) filters (32 and 64 filters, respectively) and ReLU activation functions to extract features from the sketches.
-   **Pooling Layers**: Two `MaxPooling2D` layers to downsample the feature maps and reduce computational load.
-   **Flatten Layer**: A `Flatten` layer to convert the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.
-   **Dense Layers**: Two `Dense` layers (512 and 128 neurons) with ReLU activation for classification.
-   **Dropout Layers**: Two `Dropout` layers with a rate of 0.6 to prevent overfitting.
-   **Output Layer**: A `Dense` layer with a softmax activation function to output a probability distribution across the 14 classes.

## Performance

The refined model was trained for 3 epochs and achieved the following performance on the validation set:
-   **Validation Accuracy**: 95%
-   **Validation Loss**: 0.19
-   **Total Training Time**: Approximately 24 minutes.

## Real-Time Prediction GUI

A simple graphical user interface was created using Python's Tkinter library. It provides a canvas for users to draw on and buttons to either predict the drawing or clear the canvas.

## Challenges

While the model performs well on the validation data, its accuracy on live, user-drawn sketches is lower. This is likely due to the mismatch between the heavily preprocessed training data and the "noisy" nature of real-time drawings (e.g., variations in stroke thickness, drawing style, and scale).

## Setup and Usage

To run this project, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    -   Ensure you have Python 3 and Git installed.

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/EthanSterling04/sketch-classification.git](https://github.com/EthanSterling04/sketch-classification.git)
    cd sketch-classification
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib seaborn pillow
    ```

4.  **Run the Real-Time Application:**
    -   The final cells of the notebook contain the code for the Tkinter application.
    -  Run these cells to launch the application. It will use the pre-trained `cnn_model.h5` that is included in the repository.
    -   Draw on the canvas and click "Predict" to see the model's guess.

5. **Re-training the Model (Optional):**
    -   To re-train the model from scratch, first download the raw data from the [Google Quick, Draw! Dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset).
    -   Create a `data/` directory in the project root and place the downloaded `.npy` files there.
    -   Run the notebook cells sequentially from the beginning. This will overwrite the existing `cnn_model.h5` file.
